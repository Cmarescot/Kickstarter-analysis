# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Louise wants to use Kickstarter as a way to fund her play. In this analysis we analyzed a data of various campaigns in order to discover trends among successful and unsuccessful campaigns. 
---
-In our analysis we discovered that in general there are no specific coorelation between spand of time of each campaigns and success as there were some very short campaigns that were successful.
---
-There are many successful theather campaigns over all in the Dataset. The Theather campaign are very popular in the us with a total of 525 successful and 349 unsuccesful campaigns. ![ParentCategoryOutcomes] (C:\Users\Esther\Desktop\Anlaysis Project\Crowdfunding Analysis\ParentCategoryOutcomes)

-Louise wanted to get an inside look at the theather catagory in Great Britain since she possibly wants to do a play there. After filtering through the dataset we found that in Great Britain the theater catergory is the most successful!
---
-We found that May has the most successful Kickstarter campaigns.BUT January, June, July and October had around the same failed campaign which signals that there may not be a direct coorelation between success of campaigns and month of launch ![StartDateOutcomes] (C:\Users\Esther\Desktop\Anlaysis Project\Crowdfunding Analysis\StartDateOutcomes)

-Using VLookup we were able to get some more data for Louise on some plays she saw at the Edinbrgh Festival Fringe. We were able to extract the data and present Louise with an average donation amount and the number of backers each campaign had
---
-Using measures of tendencies we were able to discover that in general the datasets are skewed, meaning that ther are some large values driving the overall distributions 
---
Our box and whiskers analysis shows that there are some outliers in both the goals and pledged amounts in great britain . 
---
-We noticed that the average or mean campaign goal in the great britain is around 4,000 euros. Louise had budged for the same amount but according to the actual pledged amounts Louise's goal falls just outside of the third quartile (is an outlier) . As a result Louise should think about lowering her goal. 
---
In General Louise has a really good shot at a successful campaign in both the US but espcially in Great Britain. She should work on lowering her budget in general and possibly looking in to launching her campaign in May.
